SBA HTTM and CSS Project 

I have created a simple grocery store web design with three pages. 
The landing page is there to inform customers of what the store offer. 
The product pages shows the customer which items are available at the moment. 
The checkout/curbside pick up page allows users to choose a pick up date and time.
